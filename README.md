# GameofMasterMind

This is a Game of MasterMind. The goal of the game is to guess a 4 digit number that is randomly generated by a computer.

If the user inputs the correct number, the user wins the game and is given the number of guesses it took to win.

To start playing, simply assemble and run the program. The game will prompt the user to input their 4 digit guess.

If the user inputs 0000, they concede to the computer and lose.

For each digit a user inputs, if the digit is equal to the digit in the same place as the target, we print "Fermi".
If the digit is equal to any other digit in the target, we print "Pico".
If not a single digit in the user's input appears anywhere in the target, then we print "Bagel".

This version comes with an out of bounds checker that does not allow for a user to input a value greater than a length of 4 digits.
This version also generates a random target number, allowing the user to play against the computer.

This version does not check the user input for repeated digits. If a user inputs repeated digits, the user can recieve confusing outputs.
The portion of the code where we compare user input to target digits needs refactoring. It is a nightmare to read and debug. Lots of documentation
has been provided to help.

Lines 39-43 contain some code that prints out the number to the user before the game begins. This is for testing. If you want to try playing against
the computer (and not cheat), you can comment out the code.
